While I've been on the sales end of things, the company I currently work for has been an Alfresco partner and I've been through training and demoed Alfresco many times over the years. I'm leaving my current company shortly to work with another Alfresco partner and moving back to an implementation role and would like to get more into development and involved in the community. I've always been an advocate of open source software and really liked the vibe of Alfresco in the early days. As I move back to solution architecture and development I'd like to give back to the community, get more depth in Alfresco, and work with like minded people.",
